# Small-C

Is Small-C 1.1 public domain ?

- Small-C was published in the US before January 1988.
- Small-C source code doesn't have a Copyright statement.
- I can't find the original issue #45 of Dr. Dobb's Journal.
- The re-print in Volume 05 is clearly copyrighted.
- All the derivative versions of Small-C that I found are copyrighted.

- So the answer is: I don't know until I can find the Copyright terms of Dr. Dobb's original issue #45.
