# Small-C

Is Small-C 1.1 public domain ?

- Small-C was published in the US before January 1988.
- Small-C source code doesn't have a Copyright statement.
- I can't find the original May 1980 issue #45 of Dr. Dobb's Journal.
- The re-print article in 1982 Volume 05 is clearly copyrighted.
- February 1976 issue of DDJ states that articles may be reprinted for any non-commercial purpose.
- All the derivative versions of Small-C that I found are copyrighted.


- So the answer is: I doubt that 1980's DDJ's copyright terms were more liberal than 1982 or 1976 ones.
So, no, Small-C 1.1 is not public domain!
